Build a production-ready Machine Learning web application using Python and Flask.

PROJECT GOAL:
Create a real-world ML application that predicts:
1) House Prices (Regression)
2) Loan Eligibility (Classification)

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT ask users to upload datasets.
- Models are already trained and saved as .pkl files.
- Users will only provide form-based inputs.

TECH STACK:
- Backend: Python (Flask)
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- ML: scikit-learn / XGBoost / LightGBM
- Deployment: Replit

BACKEND REQUIREMENTS:
- Load .pkl models using joblib
- Flask routes:
  /               → Home page
  /house          → House price form
  /loan           → Loan eligibility form
  /predict-house  → POST route for house prediction
  /predict-loan   → POST route for loan prediction
- Handle invalid inputs gracefully
- Return predictions clearly

HOUSE PRICE INPUT FIELDS:
- Bedrooms
- Bathrooms
- Flat Area (sqft)
- Lot Area (sqft)
- Condition (1–5)
- Grade (1–13)
- Zipcode

LOAN ELIGIBILITY INPUT FIELDS:
- Applicant Income
- Coapplicant Income
- Loan Amount
- Loan Term (months)
- Credit History (0 or 1)
- Property Area (Urban / Semiurban / Rural)
- Married (Yes / No)
- Education (Graduate / Not Graduate)

FRONTEND REQUIREMENTS:
- Clean, professional UI using Bootstrap
- Landing page with two cards:
  - House Price Prediction
  - Loan Eligibility Prediction
- Separate pages for each prediction
- Display results in a highlighted card
- Responsive design
- Real-life usable layout

DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS:
- app.py must run using: python app.py
- Bind Flask app to host="0.0.0.0"
- Use PORT environment variable for Replit
- Include all dependencies in requirements.txt
- App should be fully runnable on Replit without changes

OUTPUT:
- A fully working ML web application
- Ready to deploy and share
- Suitable for resume and real-world use
